## :jack_o_lantern: hi, i'm mÃ©ch :jack_o_lantern:

I currently work at [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/index.html) as a GIS Specialist and provide consultations on spatial analysis, GIS, and data visualizations. I'm a curious and motivated individual who's always interested in trying new tools to make beautiful and informative visualizations. 

- :sunflower: Iâ€™m currently learning R, Python, and re-learning statistics!
