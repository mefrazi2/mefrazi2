## :jack_o_lantern: hi, i'm mÃ©ch :jack_o_lantern:

I currently work at [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/index.html) as a GIS Specialist, providing consultations on spatial analysis, GIS, and data visualizations. I'm a curious and motivated individual who's interested in trying new tools to make simple, yet informative, visualizations. 

- :sunflower: Iâ€™m currently learning R and :snake: Python. And re-learning statistics!
